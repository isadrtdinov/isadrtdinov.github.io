**Abstract:** Consistent success of BERT-like models in language processing has lead to attempts to adapt
masked modeling task to other data domains and create a universal framework for pre-training
without manual annotations. In this seminar, we will have an overview of relatively recent (2021-2022)
approaches for masked image modeling (MIM). We will start with a brief history of self-supervised
methods for images and then discuss different masking strategies, image-processing pipelines and
what targets are suitable for masked modeling. We will consider BEiT, SimMIM, MAE, UM-MAE and MaskFeat.
