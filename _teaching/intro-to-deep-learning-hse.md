The course is dedicated to the study of deep learning, which is the fastest developing area of
machine learning. Students will learn what types of machine learning tasks can be solved using neural
networks and what types of neural networks are currently in use. The course has a strong practical focus,
requiring students to train neural networks on the PyTorch framework using the Python programming language.
The course covers topics of images, texts and generative models.
