This course focuses on the methodologies and techniques used to train
large models on extensive datasets across various data domains, including
images, text, and audio. The course provides in-depth coverage of
self-supervised learning approaches, which have become crucial for
leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled data. Topics include data preprocessing
and augmentation for different modalities, architectural considerations
for scaling deep learning models, and strategies for distributed and
parallel training.
